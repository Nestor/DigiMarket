This is the custom cron job feature, where any addon developers can add their custom cron scripts
DO NOT MODIFY OR USE THE cron system IN THE core FOLDER if you do then you will be refused support by our developers.
If you use this folder like intended, then we have no reason to refuse support.
So if your addon wants you to place a file in the cronjob area in the core part of the script, place it in here instead!

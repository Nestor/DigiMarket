This is <h1>NOT AT ALL</h1> finished or near finished
Follow this if you want to see changes and progress made, or even want to test what I've done so far and start to develop add-ons for it.
I request that you DO NOT re-upload this content or I will make this private again and no one will see it and you will be stuck like a loser with content that is only half-finished.
Upon the beta release I will try and get some other PHP developers to review this script and try to find vulnerabilities, if you want to do it in the meantime, please by all means.
<h2>I am perfectly happy to take suggestions (just add it to the issues bit and write [SUGGESTION] in the title or I will close it)</h2>
